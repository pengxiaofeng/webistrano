WebistranoPrivileges
====================

webistrano_privileges is a simple Rails plugin that introduces access control to Webistrano-1.3. After applying the plugin to your working webistrano project copy, and running two shell commands, webistrano will be accomodating a simple access control scheme. Admins can manipulate all projects. Non-admins can manipulate only THEIR projects. Admins can add and remove users to projects.

What the plugin basically does is:
- it generates a migration for a many-to-many relation between users and projects.
- it generates a route and a controller for adding and removing users from projects
- it replaces some views to present the added functionality.
- it introduces some logic to secure unauthorized access to projects from non-related users. 


After installing the plugin:
============================
- run the generate command, accept whenever prompted for overwriting existing files:

	>> ruby script/generate privileges_extensions
	
- migrate

	>> rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
